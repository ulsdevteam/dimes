Card indexes also exist.\n\nAlthough most of the information that appears in these records also occurs in grant administration and program and policy files of the Rockefeller Foundation and the General Education Board, as the case may be, the format of these records and the configurations of the information make the records unique in the context of the Foundation and the GEB collections, and offer insight into how the Foundation responded to the congressional investigations.\n\nTwo particular aspects of the Cox and Reece Investigation files not duplicated in the main body of the Rockefeller Foundation and the General Education Board records are the source and citation summaries, as well as the subject files and those documenting the political climate.\n\n","group":{"identifier":"/collections/WY7fpswEV3oLhyjiArpHES","title":"Rockefeller Foundation records"},"index":144225},{"title":"Rockefeller Foundation records, Field Staff","type":"collection","online":false,"hit_count":0,"online_hit_count":0,"uri":"/collections/fhXiFnMLRCN9wbXKoffn6L","dates":"1913-1974","description":"Contains reports, surveys and collected papers from Field Staff of the Rockefeller Foundation, International Health Board/Division, and China Medical Board.
