Included in this designation are organizations directly connected with the Rockefeller Foundation, such as the International Health Division (which was a part of the Foundation that was governed separately until 1951); organizations indirectly related to the Foundation, such as the Spelman Fund of New York and the China Medical Board, Inc.; and other, independent organizations that received support from the Foundation. Much of the material concerns the work of the International Health Division. There is a large section on the war relief of the Foundation (1914 to 1918).
