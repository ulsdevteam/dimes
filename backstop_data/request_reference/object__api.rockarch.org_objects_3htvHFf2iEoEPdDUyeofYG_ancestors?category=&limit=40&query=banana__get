Included in this designation are organizations directly connected with the Rockefeller Foundation, such as the International Health Division (which was a part of the Foundation that was governed separately until 1951); organizations indirectly related to the Foundation, such as the Spelman Fund of New York and the China Medical Board, Inc.; and other, independent organizations that received support from the Foundation. Much of the material concerns the work of the International Health Division. There is a large section on the war relief of the Foundation (1914 to 1918). Additional items of interest are a progress report on nursing education (1928), an anthropological survey (1932 to 1933), and the files on international studies and international relations.","group":null,"index":null,"child":{"title":"International - General (No Program), Subseries 100.GEN","type":"collection","online":false,"hit_count":0,"online_hit_count":0,"uri":"/collections/ChqRRrDVPGqYiDftR4WszC","dates":"1913-1958","description":null,"group":null,"index":null}}}}}}
