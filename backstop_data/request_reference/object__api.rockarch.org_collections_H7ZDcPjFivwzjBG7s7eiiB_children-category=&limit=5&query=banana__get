Records also include minutes, evaluations, and supplementary material of a general nature about the Conflict in International Relations/International Relations program, as well as documentation of grants awarded and fellowship files.  Many of the grant and fellowship files are enriched by supplementary material, which may be in the form of publications, papers, reports, agendas or minutes of conferences, books, or other printed material.  The supplementary material often contains the fruit that has resulted from a grant or fellowship.\n\tThe material in this series primarily covers the period from 1972/73 - when the Conflict in International Relations program was first established - through 1986, when the International Relations program was terminated.  Earliest dated material, however, dates from 1960 and latest is from 1994.","group":{"identifier":"/collections/WY7fpswEV3oLhyjiArpHES","title":"Rockefeller Foundation records"},"index":24882},{"title":"Rockefeller Foundation records, projects, SG 1.3-SG 1.8 (A76-A82)","type":"collection","online":false,"hit_count":0,"online_hit_count":0,"uri":"/collections/JueTxNcPK9PL6hzdFmG3H5","dates":"undated, undated","description":null,"group":{"identifier":"/collections/WY7fpswEV3oLhyjiArpHES","title":"Rockefeller Foundation records"},"index":26370}]}
