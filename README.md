# DIMES

A React web application which provides the front-end user interface for the online discovery of archival collections, objects, and agents at the Rockefeller Archive Center.

DIMES is part of [Project Electron](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/project_electron), an initiative to build sustainable, open and user-centered infrastructure for the archival management of digital records at the [Rockefeller Archive Center](http://rockarch.org/).

## Local Development

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and clone the repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/dimes.git

Install dependencies and run the development server:

    $ yarn install
    $ yarn start


## Dev deployment

Updated images are built each time a commit is pushed to base. To deploy in vSphere, first update the image by pulling the most recent version:

    $ docker -H {vsphere host}:{vsphere port} --tlsverify pull rockarch/dimes:development

Get the ID of the running container

    $ docker -H {vsphere host}:{vsphere port} --tlsverify container ls

Then stop the running container:

    $ docker -H {vsphere host}:{vsphere port} --tlsverify stop {container ID}

Finally, start the updated container:

    $ docker -H {vsphere host}:{vsphere port} --tlsverify run -d -p 3001:80 rockarch/dimes:development

DIMES will then be available at the vSphere host, port 3001.
